# Hospital Readmission Project

## Overview

This repository contains code and documentation for a predictive modeling project focused on understanding and predicting patient readmission rates. The project utilizes exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques and machine learning algorithms to gain insights into factors affecting patient readmission and build a predictive model.

TBD while progress is constantly being made.
